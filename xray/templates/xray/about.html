            Introduction
            <hr>
            <p class="abp">Automatic Number Plate Recognition has become an important aspect of our lives, and it will continue to do so in the future if it is compatible with future transportation technologies. In recent years, automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) or license plate recognition (LPR) has proven to be one of the most effective methods for vehicle surveillance. The concept of autonomous vehicles opens up a slew of opportunities for fundamentally altering transportation systems. It can be used in a variety of public locations for a variety of reasons, including traffic safety enforcement, automatic toll tax collection, car park systems, and automatic vehicle parking systems. 
                While ANPR technology comes in a variety of forms, the goal is the same  to provide a highly good system for scanning a vehicle without the need for human intervention.
                This technology eliminates the need for tedious physical labour on every busy day, saves money on labour, and is significantly more efficient than people. Once the number of any car has been received as text, it can be displayed, saved in the database, or searched for details across the full database. This project is so versatile that it may be used as a standalone application or as part of a larger project after being converted to software. </p>

            Motivation
            <hr>
            <p class="abp">The motivation behind this project is unlike India, unlike other countries, has a unique set of ANPR requirements because to its population of one billion people. Highway surveillance parking management, and neighborhood law enforcement security are the most common uses of ANPR. In India, one person dies every four minutes with the majority of these deaths resulting from excessive speeding. ANPR is used to track the average speed of cars and can detect those that exceed the speed limit. A fine ticket can be created automatically in this situation by estimating the distance between two cameras. This aids in the maintenance of law and order, which can help to reduce the number of road fatalities. ANPR is the most effective method for parking management. Vehicles with registered plates can enter parking areas automatically however non-registered vehicles will be charged at the time of check in and check out. Every year 200,000 cars are stolen in India. This number can be reduced if appropriate measures are taken and the ANPR system is utilized to track automobiles so that if vehicles are stolen, law enforcement can determine when, where, and how a stolen vehicle travelled.

            Objective
            <hr>
            <p class="abp">To examine the many Computer Vision techniques currently in use in ANPR in order to choose the most effective and relevant ones. To learn how to apply these strategies and maximize their potential the evaluate the various Machine Learning algorithms and select the most appropriate for LNPR To have a better understanding of how they work and adapt them to the LNPR application To create an ANPR application that is efficient, quick, and dependable, and that can compete with other recently produced ANPR systems with similar features. In addition to the ANPR application, construct a supplementary application that quantitatively analyses the ANPR system's performance.. To train and test Machine Learning algorithms, as well as to evaluate the performance of the produced system, a full dataset of car photos must be created. </p>

            Scope
            <hr>
            <p class="abp">Everyday life, public health, and the global economy are all in ruins. Pathogenic laboratory assays, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), are time-consuming and frequently provide false-negative results. We proposed a machine learning approach for classifying and identifying COVID-19 from chest X-rays in this study.</p>
            <p class="abp">It has the potential to reduce frontline radiologists' stress, improve early detection, isolation, and treatment, and so aid in the control of the pandemic.</p>
